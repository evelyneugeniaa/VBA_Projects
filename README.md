# VBA Projects

## - Project 1 (Complaint Tool)
### About the project
Nowadays, the issue of sustainability is very important, and this also applies to the company where I worked during my internship. To achieve this, all work processes are being converted from paper to digital. I am responsible for digitizing the workflows for complaints to suppliers. 


### Download the tool

- Step 1 : Download this excel file "Reklamation _Master.xlsm" and save it to your local computer. Don't forget to enable the macro.

### Overview of what the tool looks like

## - Project 2 (Filter Tool)

### About the project
During my time as a working student, I was responsible for developing a filter tool, as the existing filter method with pivot tables is very complex and not user-friendly.

### Download the Tool

- Step 1 : Download this excel file "BoM_Skalk_(AKTUELLE VERSION).xlsm" and save it to your local computer. Don't forget to enable the macro.

## - Project 3 (Offer Tool)

### About the project
A professional cost calculation is one of the most important building blocks for successful projects. It provides information about all the costs that will be incurred during the course of the project even before the project begins. On this basis, it is possible to offer the customer a price. On the other hand, it provides the project team in your own company with a monetary framework that they can use as a guide. An exact calculation is therefore essential in every project phase. As a working student at a leading provider of innovative and efficient solutions for airport logistics, I support the Engineering Electrical System department in the automation systems division to automate the cost estimation process to make it faster and more efficient, because before I developed the Offer Tool, it could take up to 2 weeks to calculate a large project. With the Offer Tool, the calculation can now be done within 15-30 minutes, depending on the size of the project.

#### General offer procedures

![Screenshot 2024-04-14 233851](https://github.com/evelyneugeniaa/VBA_Projects/assets/166989123/bd4090f0-b422-4a53-b693-d7951dcf7b12)

From a Bill of Quantities (BoQ) file, which contains all the required mechanical components, important information about the scope of work, the required materials and labor as well as the total cost of the project is calculated. 

### Working Instruction
For the Tool to work, 7 files are required, e.g. the material and cost calculation files for the cables, the cable containment, the mechanical and electrical components, the KPIs for the scope of work and the bid and pricing form to prepare the offer for the electrical installation to the electrical subcontractor. As the cost calculation here is very complex, I have developed a user-friendly interface so that anyone can use this tool properly. All required Excel files will work in the background when you start the program (user interface).

- Step 1 : Download all these Files to your Local Computer and save it under Desktop. Note: It is very important to save all these files in the same folder!

- Step 2 : Unblock Macros in all Files Without opening the Excel file, right click on the Excel file and in the window that opens, click PROPERTIES, and then click the GENERAL tab, and then click Unblock. Then click APPLY. and then click OK. See image on the left for example.

- Step 3 : Double Click the „New Tool.xlsm” to open the files. Once you open this file the 6 other files will also automatically open.The Main Menu will be shown. Click the green button to do the Cost Calculation for the LLC Material.

### A. LLC Material Costing Tool
So before we can count all the KPIs Man Efforts and prepare Bid and Pricing Form for the electrical installation to the Subcontractor first we have to count all the electrical components first.
In this section I will introduce you how this material costing tool works.

### B. Calculation for Electrical Installation
Once we have counted all the material quantities and their costs, we can automatically transfer these material quantities to the bid and pricing form.

#### - Reloading and Editing the existing files to the tool
Once we have exported all the files for the calculation, we sometimes want to load them back into the tool and edit them. This screenshot shows how this works.
